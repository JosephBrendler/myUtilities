# cloudsync.conf
# Configuration file for  cloudsync, synchronization of a (mesh or hub-spoke
#    topology) set of rudimentary "cloud" participants on your network.
# Author: Joe Brendler 1 June 2014. Packaged with ebuild 2 February 2017.

# This file is sourced in the cloudsync script, so each non-commented
#    line must be a valid script command (variable assignment)
# Default values are commented below. Un-comment and modify the values
#    below according to the layout of your system.

# MyPackagesROOT is the root of a tree where your system puts binaries
#   resulting from "buildpkg" -- in can be your system root /, or the
#   $ROOT target of another architecture's binaries if you use crossdev.
# The script must default to "/" so do NOT comment this out or modify it
#   unless you assign it below, for a different architecture.
MyPackagesROOT="/"
# (1) To configure synchronization of binary packages on a package SERVER hosting
#   binaries of its OWN arch, you should leave this set to "/".
# (2) To configure synchronization of binary packages on a package Server (or a
#   cross-compiler) hosting binary packages cross-compiled for another arch,
#   such as the arm family ("armv6j" for raspberry pi or "armv7a" for pi2),
#   uncomment and customize the assignment of MyPackagesROOT="/usr/armv6j..." below.
# (3) To configure a CLIENT of a binary package server, (such as an actual or virtual
#   raspberry pi, leave the line below commented out and leave MyPackagesROOT
#   assigned to "/".
# This will enable the script to properly prepare and clean up the directories
#   containing those binary packages (i.e. to manage ownership and permissions
#   for those files, and to use portage's "emaint" function to ensure $PKGDIR/Packages
#   is updated and has the right hashes.
#MyPackagesROOT="/usr/armv6j-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi/"
#MyPackagesROOT="/usr/armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi/"

# In the sections below, you may reassign the defaults asociated with the three
#   categories of cloudsync synchronization - content, scripts, and packages.
# Note that in each case, the serverlist variable tells THIS participant to sync
#   with which remote sync-mesh participants.
# --- do not include leading nor trailing "/" in folderlists
# --- do not include trailing "/" in directory names

# for content servers -------------------------
# change to yes if you want to sync content at all
