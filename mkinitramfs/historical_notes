Historical Notes regarding Joe Brendler's "mkinitramfs" project

----[ Notes from init.conf ]-------------
   rev 8 Jan 10  - (o/a) initial build
   rev 26 Jan 13 - (ver 2.x) added filesystem support for / and /usr, now that
                   udev >181 requires /usr mounted in intiramfs
   rev 18 Jan 14 - (ver 3.x) added support for identification of devces by UUID; added optional use of splashutils
   rev 22 Jan 14 - added timeout for mdev, drop to passphrase
   rev 09 Nov 2016 - to do list:
    1 - accept a *list* of key containing pass-devices (list of UUIDs)
    2 - possibly replace cryptab with code that scans for "LUKS" partitions,
        tries available keys, or asks for password to unlock them
    3 - use lddtree (python pkg) to simplify loading dependencies
    4 - default init.conf to no splash
    5 - output initramfs to a format that grub2 will recognize, so I can use grub-mkconfig
    6 - integrate "makeinitramfs" and output directly to /boot (after checking for it)

# Historical note:
# Earlier versions (1.x) of this initramfs builder expecte the user to manually
#   identify "/dev/sda1" style device names and to manually create the corresponding
#   device nodes in the initramfs with a command like "cp -a /dev /usr/src/initramfs"
# Later versions (2.x) mitigated the uncertainty in how the kernel would assign such
#   device names by adding this mdev functionality to enable dynamic device node
#   creation.  (however, the user still needed to supply the init script with a list
#   of device names to unlock...)
# Starting with version 3.x, the user was encouraged to use UUIDs to identify
#   the block devices to unlock, eliminating that remaining uncertainty.
# Bottom line: in version 4.x, we'll eliminate the config variable init_mdev_support,
# and just use mdev

# Historical note: In update to ver 4.x, we changed to a *list* of devices that are
#   authorized to be used to unlock the system's encrypted luks-formatted devices.
# Format note: use '\' character to use multiple lines. In the example below, the user
#   identifies the following four authorized devices:
#UUID="ABCD-EA85" (xD card)
#UUID="1234-3072" (MS/MSpro card)
#UUID="9876-C3EC" (usb thumb drive)
#UUID="EFCB-C4A3" (usb thumb drive)
#
# Example:
# init_passdevice_list=" \
# ABCD-EA85 \
# 1234-3072 \
# 9876-C3EC \
# EFCB-C4A3"

----[ Notes from init script ]-----------------------
#    rev 1 Jan 2009 adding  mini_udev and separator functions
#    rev 5 Jan 2009 adding cryptsetup of multiple volumes opened w/ key-file
#    rev 12 Feb 2011 bugfix for new busybox shell compatibility
#    rev 20 Feb 2011 further bugfix for busybox-v1.17.4 shell compatibility
#        (bb sh chokes on or ignores parameter substitution like ${init_passdevice##*" "} or ${line:0:4}
#    rev 18 Sep 2012 - modified text output format of separator, using "-[ ... ]-" instead of "-| ... |-"
#        also fixed attempts to umount passdevice when method is "prompt" (passdevice not mounted)
#    rev 22 Jan 2013 - mod to mount /usr volume (as reqd by udev >181
#    rev 26 Jan 2013 - generalized filesystem for / and /usr as init.conf variables
#    rev 31 Mar 2013 - revised mdev section consequent to new udev and busybox publication
#    rev 21 Aug 2013 - revised to launch systemd as alt init system
#    rev 18 Jan 2014 - lvm2-2.02.103 broke the automatic creation of device nodes for lvs,
#        so the script fixes with vgscan --mknodes (looped until successful)
#                    - also removed use of  gentoo's systemd (not yet ready for prime time)
#                    - added optional use of splashutils
#    rev 21/22 Jan 2014 - bugfixes and improved progress messaging
#                    - added support for UUID device specification for passdevice and encrypted drives
#    rev 14 Sep 2014 - updated as part of auto-initramfs-building process with mkinitramfs.sh and makeinitramfs.sh
#                    - tried bugfix for init_passdevice with UUID specification [still having issues with
#                       findfs command in busybox shell...
#    rev 2-7 Jan 15  - bugfixes for blank lines in cryptab, simplified with script_header
#                    - bugfix for findfs (included binary and needed libraries)
#                    - bugfix for "mycmd" and added shred
# rev 09 Nov 2016 - to do list:
#   1 - accept a *list* of key containing pass-devices (list of UUIDs)
#   2 - possibly replace cryptab with code that scans for "LUKS" partitions,
#       tries available keys, or asks for password to unlock them
#   3 - use lddtree (python pkg) to simplify loading dependencies
#   4 - default init.conf to no splash
#   5 - output initramfs to a format that grub2 will recognize, so I can use grub-mkconfig
