# configuration file for initramfs init script

# Joe Brendler
#   rev 8 Jan 10
#   rev 26 Jan 13 - added filesystem support for / and /usr, now that
#                   udev >181 requires /usr mounted in intiramfs
#   rev 18 Jan 14 - added optional use of splashutils
#   rev 22 Jan 14 - added timeout for mdev, drop to passphrase
# rev 09 Nov 2016 - to do list:
#   1 - accept a *list* of key containing pass-devices (list of UUIDs)
#   2 - possibly replace cryptab with code that scans for "LUKS" partitions,
#       tries available keys, or asks for password to unlock them
#   3 - use lddtree (python pkg) to simplify loading dependencies
#   4 - default init.conf to no splash
#   5 - output initramfs to a format that grub2 will recognize, so I can use grub-mkconfig
#   6 - integrate "makeinitramfs" and output directly to /boot (after checking for it)
#
# change defaults to tailor for your environment
#   all configurations must be legitimate variable assignment statements
#   because they are assigned in the init script by simply sourcing this file

# location of the cryptab file, identifying encrypted devices and the names luks 
#   should use to address them
init_cryptab="/cryptab"

# To enable bootup without user intervention at terminal (such as when w/o monitor),
#   identify the device containing the cryptsetup passkey that init will use to unlock
#   the encrypted devices.  Default is no device, and init will prompt for passphrase.
# Devices must be identified by a reliable device name, label, or by UUID (preferred).
# Hint: Using any linux boot disk, you can use "blkid -c /dev/null | grep -i LUKS" 
#   to get the UUIDs of all of your luks-formatted block devices.
# Historical note: In update to ver 4.x, we changed to a *list* of devices that are
#   authorized to be used to unlock the system's encrypted luks-formatted devices.
# Format note: use '\' character to use multiple lines. In the example below, the user
#   identifies the following four authorized devices:
#UUID="ABCD-EA85" (xD card)
#UUID="1234-3072" (MS/MSpro card)
#UUID="9876-C3EC" (usb thumb drive)
#UUID="EFCB-C4A3" (usb thumb drive)
#
# Example:
# init_passdevice_list=" \
# ABCD-EA85 \
# 1234-3072 \
# 9876-C3EC \
# EFCB-C4A3"
init_passdevice_list=" \
ADC6-EA85 \
407A-3072 \
9BE8-C3EC \
EFC5-C4A3"

# The init_passdevice's mount point and filesystem must also be specified here 
init_passdevice_mount_point="/mnt/thumb"
init_passdevice_fs="vfat"

# Enable debugging output - like increased verbosity
#init_DEBUG="true"
init_DEBUG="false"

# if an initpassdevice is used, specify the full quoted pathname of the file containing
#   nothing but a single line with the hex key
# Note: if you already have a key with a passphrase you can use hashalot to generate
#   the corresponding key file with the command:
#    hashalot -s "$salt" -x "<hash>"
#   where $salt is the initialization vector avaliable using the command:
#    cryptsetup luksDump <device>
#   Default is null, as above.
#init_keyfile=
init_keyfile="/crypt/dat"

# Specify the time in minutes you want init to wait for mdev to identify
# your init_passdevice before giving up and prompting you for a passphrase.
# (this can be any integer greater than or equal to zero)
init_mdev_wait=1

# If you want more time to read the information provided by init during
#   bootup, change this.  This can be helpful in troubleshooting your
#   initial configuration.  This is a multiplyer for the number of seconds 
#   used for "sleep" commands in the init script 
init_wait=1

# Identify the filesystem(s) used by your boot device(s).
# Note that if you have /usr on a separate partition, it must
# be mounted by initramfs also (hence the defaults below).
#init_root_fs="reiserfs"
#init_usr_fs="reiserfs"
init_root_fs="ext4"
init_usr_fs="ext4"

# Tell init whether to use splash by choosing "yes" or "no"
#   You also need to set the theme in your grub kernel command line
#   example: 
#   kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/mapper/lvm-root splash=silent,fadein,theme:emergence console=tty1
#   Chose theme from: 
#   [ emerge-world | emergence | gentoo | livecd-2007.0 | livecd-12.0 | natural_gentoo ]
init_splash="yes"
#init_splash="no"

# --------------- Additional Security ----------------

# lock_down:
# Note that the purpose of encrypting your drives was to protect them
#   against unauthorized access when your machine is unattended (such as
#   when you inadvertently lose or simply lose custody of a notebook computer),
#   by preventing an unauthorized person from reading the drive if they were
#   to try to boot your machine (or put the drive in their own machine).
# This security is only really achieved if you prevent such an adversary
#   from getting any form of root access -- to include from your rescue
#   shell.  Thus, you should strongly consider changing the following 
#   option to "yes" once you feel you've achieved a stable configuration.
init_lock_down="no"
#init_lock_down="yes"

# two-factor authentication:
# To further secure your machine against the possibility that someone may
#   "find" (or steal) your key-file (such as if they were to gain access to
#   the usb drive you have stored it on), you may change the following option
#   to "yes" and setting a password.
# Note that this will require that you enter the password below in order to 
#   execute the init script.  Thus, you will need to have a monitor and keyboard
#   connected.
# !! init_two_factor_password must be single-quoted (apostrophes) to allow
#   use of special characters in password
init_two_factor_required="no"
#init_two_factor_required="yes"
init_two_factor_password=''
#init_two_factor_password='1234qwer!@#$QWER'

# If you need dynmaic device support, using mini_udev, say "yes" here.
# Historical note:
# Earlier versions (1.x) of this initramfs builder expecte the user to manually
#   identify "/dev/sda1" style device names and to manually create the corresponding
#   device nodes in the initramfs with a command like "cp -a /dev /usr/src/initramfs"
# Later versions (2.x) mitigated the uncertainty in how the kernel would assign such
#   device names by adding this mdev functionality to enable dynamic device node
#   creation.  (however, the user still needed to supply the init script with a list
#   of device names to unlock...)
# Starting with version 3.x, the user was encouraged to use UUIDs to identify
#   the block devices to unlock, eliminating that remaining uncertainty.
# Bottom line: you should say "yes" here.
# This can be helpful for troubleshooting when first configuring an initramfs, 
#   if you are unsure how your kernel will identify your devices.  You may want to 
#   enable this option during initial configuration, and then disable it after            
#   identifying the devices you need in cryptab.
# Note also that if you make significant changes to your system, udev may identify
#   your devices differently, thus invalidating your configuration.  If this happens,
#   you will need to change device names in cryptab, and either create device nodes
#   in /dev, or use mdev to identify your devices and build nodes for them in /dev
#init_mdev_support="no"
init_mdev_support="yes"
