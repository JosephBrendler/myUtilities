# sSMTP aliases
# 
# Format:	local_account:outgoing_address:mailhub
#
# Example: root:your_login@your.domain:mailhub.your.domain[:port]
# where [:port] is an optional port number that defaults to 25.

# with the following example all emails sent from root; when recived
# will show in the from line: From: admin <gentoo@freethinker.net>
# in this case <gentoo> is the box name in  /etc/conf.d/hostname
# and <freethinker.net> the domainame in /etc/resolve.conf
#root:gentoo@freethinker.net:smtp.broadband.rogers.com
root:joe.brendler@gmail.com:smtp.gmail.com:587

# if a regular user sends an email without a costumized format then
# then the from line would show: From: john@smtp.broadband.rogers.com

# if you wish to have your own regular user sending emails with a better
# looking format like root has, then add something like this for each other user
#jack:jack@freethinker.net:smtp.broadband.rogers.com

# what ever you put here <:jack@freethinker.net:> can be costumized
# by your own taste. For a regular user there is no need to change
# anything in /etc/passwd
