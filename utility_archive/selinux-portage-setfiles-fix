# https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/FAQ#Portage_fails_to_label_files_because_.22setfiles.22_does_not_work_anymore
# Portage uses the setfiles command to set the labels of the files it installs.
# However, that command is a dynamically linked executable, so any update in its
# depending libraries (libselinux.so, libsepol.so, libaudit.so and of course libc.so)
# might cause for the application to fail. Gentoo's standard solution (revdep-rebuild)
# will not work, since the tool will try to rebuild sys-apps/policycoreutils, which will
# fail to install because Portage cannot set the file labels.

# The solution is to rebuild sys-apps/policycoreutils while disabling Portage's SELinux
# support, then label the installed files manually using chcon, based on the feedback
# received from matchpathcon.


FEATURES="-selinux" emerge --oneshot policycoreutils
for FILE in $(qlist policycoreutils)
do
  CONTEXT=$(matchpathcon -n ${FILE})
  chcon ${CONTEXT} ${FILE}
done
