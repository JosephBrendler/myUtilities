# source ${PN} - specific usage-module which should be built in the same format
# this file must contain legitimate bash assignments and commands
# it will be sourced by the using script via the sourcing of script_header_joetoo_extended usage() function
# Note: options i, n, s, r, v, q are already used by the default cmdline processor
# This module should end with a natural return to the sourcing script (which will exit)
