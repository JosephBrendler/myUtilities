# custom configuration for kernelupdate

# original commneted entries below are default values copy/edit to change them
# all non-commented lines must be valid bash commands. (this file is sourced by main script)
#
#
# VERBOSE - Logical dependent on script_header_joetoo, use for debugging
#VERBOSE=$TRUE
#
# verbosity - how much debug info? higer # = more
#verbosity=3
#
# user - used to set ownership of kernel development files
#user="joe"
#
# makeopts - set -j# and -l#
#  -j (--jobs) is the number of simultaneous jobs (basic recommendation is (2 * #cpus) + 1)
#     (note: total #cpus can be high, in a distcc environment)
#  -l (--load-average) limits creation of parallel tasks based on the current load average
#     (do not count remote cpus; basic recommendation is #cpus +1 )
#makeopts="-j9 -l5"  # example for 4 core system
# Aggressive setting --
makeopts=" -j$(( $(( 2 * $(nproc) )) + 1 )) -l$(( $(nproc) + 1 ))"
#   However, another consider RAM usage. As of 2024, gcc may take 1.5 GB to 2 GB of RAM
#   per job. Lower the MAKEOPTS value to provide at least 2G RAM per cpu, so the system can
#   compile without hitting swap very often slowing things down
# Conserviative setting --
#makeopts=" -j$(( $(free -g | grep Mem: | awk '{print $2}') / 2)) -l$(( $(nproc) + 1 ))"
#
# features - select or de-select features (recommend turning off distcc if otherwise used)
features=" -userpriv -distcc -distcc-pump"

# arch - what architecture?

# cross_compile - tuple indicating target for cross-compilation

cross_compile="aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-"
#
# model - what device? Used to select device tree file (dtb), so it must name a dtb file produced by
#         the command "${make_model} dtbs" (run manually in kernel build directory to list)
#model="rk3288-tinker-s"
model="rk3399-rock-pi-4c-plus"

#
# kernel - name of the destination bootable kernel image when deployed

# build_root - path to cross development directory tree for this arch/target/model

#
# my_devel_dir - source repository from which to upload content to github (omit trailing '/')
#my_devel_dir="/home/joe/myUtilities/sys-kernel"
#
# my_devel_dir_credentials - loc. of github user/password (put in .git to avoid upload)

# INTERACTIVE - ask user y/n to proceed from one command sequnce step to the next
INTERACTIVE=${TRUE}
#
# Note: if it doesn't exist, the first run of kernelupdate will create
#  the build_root directory tree.
#
# First run will also explain that you must retreive kernel sources and
#  symlink ${build_root}/linux to those sources.
# The program will keep that directory clean and build your output -
#  kernel(s), modules, and dtb file(s) in the ${distrib_dir}

#SSH_AUTH_SOC - authorization socket for ssh-agent/-add as fixed env var (allows re-use)

# host_dir - location inside build_root to store kernel images for xen client use via symlink
