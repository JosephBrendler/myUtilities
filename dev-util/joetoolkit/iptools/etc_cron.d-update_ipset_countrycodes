# /etc/cron.d/update_ipset_countrycodes
# based on update_ipdeny by BoneKracker 4 November 2011
# Modified: Joe Brendler 21 Feb 2015, further adopted for update_ipset_countrycodes 17 Feb 2022

# Twice per day, poll for update to ipsets for each two-letter country coded top level domain (TLD)
# Note: this will enable other ipset lists, like ipdeny, to refer to countrycode ipsets

# To check timing: grep "IPSet: .. updated" /var/log/crond.log

# twice daily, update the ipsets for geo-blocked countries, so shorewall can block them

# crontab fields:
# 0 - The minute it will run
# 1 - The hour (out of a 24 hour day) it'll run
# 2 - The day of the month that it'll run
# 3 - The month it'll run (in this case March)
# 4 - The day of the week it'll run. Where 0 or 7 is Sunday, 6 is Saturday. In this case it's...
#     0=Sunday, 1=Monday 2=Tuesday, 3=Wednesday, 4=Thursday, 5=Friday, 6=Saturday, 7=Sunday
# * in any of the above slots would mean all of them
# A range can be given as well, such as 1-4
# You can also specify specific values with a comma between them
# You can also add a username between the times it can run and the command like so:
#     0 1,6,12,18 2-10 3 4 joe /usr/bin/sometask
#       to run the command as a certain user on the 2nd through 10th days of a month
#       at 1:00AM, 6:00AM, 12 noon, and 6:00PM
