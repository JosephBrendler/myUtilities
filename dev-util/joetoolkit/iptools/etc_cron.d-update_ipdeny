# twice daily, update the ipsets for geo-blocked countries, so shorewall can block them
# Reference: http://www.ipdeny.com/ipblocks/data/countries/

# Example of job definition:

# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...

54  10  *  *  * root       /usr/local/sbin/ipdeny
54  22  *  *  * root       /usr/local/sbin/ipdeny

# crontab fields:
# 0 - The minute it will run
# 1 - The hour (out of a 24 hour day) it'll run
# 2 - The day of the month that it'll run
# 3 - The month it'll run (in this case March)
# 4 - The day of the week it'll run. Where 0 or 7 is Sunday, 6 is Saturday. In this case it's...
#     0=Sunday, 1=Monday 2=Tuesday, 3=Wednesday, 4=Thursday, 5=Friday, 6=Saturday, 7=Sunday
# * in any of the above slots would mean all of them
# A range can be given as well, such as 1-4
# You can also specify specific values with a comma between them
# You can also add a username between the times it can run and the command like so:
#     0 1,6,12,18 2-10 3 4 joe /usr/bin/sometask
#       to run the command as a certain user on the 2nd through 10th days of a month
#       at 1:00AM, 6:00AM, 12 noon, and 6:00PM
