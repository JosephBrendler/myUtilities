#-----[ variables ]----------------------------------------------------

# NOTE: varlist variables are initialized by app_configure_posix() and displayed by show_config();
# the basic set of varlist variables is defined in script_header_joetoo and can be extended
# either in the using script or in its .conf files.
# An example is provided in the joetoo_cli_example script and in the template joetoo_cli_example.conf
#
# BREAK tells display_vars to add a newline spacer in its output
# $LOCALIZED exemplifies use of the joetoo pseudo-boolean data type for POSIX scripts
# $EXAMPLE and $DEFAULTS are pseudo-booleans defined in joetoo_cli_example_local.cmdline_arg_handler
# $INITIALIZED_ME and $SOURCED_ME exemplify use of the joetoo yn data type
# Note how each is named and how these types are prefixed in the varlist, to inform initialize_vars
# and display_vars how to handle them.
# $longone is a long string defined in script_header_joetoo to test and illustrate smart wrapping
# by the smart_wrap_n() function. its name is prefixed "lv." in this localized extension of varlist
# to indicate (long variable), so display_vars will use smart_wrap_n() to display the content of
# $longone (which is long-one btw, not long-gone)
#
# CAVEAT: varlist is instantiated when script_header_joetoo is sourced (above), so it IS safe to add
# variable names to it in a "variables" section at the top of your main script, but note that
# the standard joetoo cli script layout calls app_configure_posix() after that --
# so anything you add to varlist before app_configure_posix will be over-written when app_configure_posix
# calls initialize_var. which sets all bool. to $FALSE, all yn. to "no" and all others to ""
#
# Bottom line: you can append variable names to varlist at the top of your script, but if you do, you
# ALSO need to reassign them AFTER app_configure_posix runs. Thus it is "easier" to just append
# variable names to varlist in the .conf file, which app_configure_posix() loads AFTER it calls
# initialize_vars, but be sure to also assign them, b/c they will not be initialized otherwise
LOCALIZED=$FALSE; INITIALIZED_ME="no"
varlist="${varlist} BREAK bool.LOCALIZED yn.INITIALIZED_ME"

#-----[ functions ]----------------------------------------------------

# note: this "mini" version (joetoo_cli_example_mini) is a template for scripts
#  wherein the tasks do not require seqencing and interactive oversight.
#  Thus, they can be coded directly into the scripts main body, or its
#  internal functions, or both, as illustrated in this template
# As such this "mini" version does not have or need an
#   initialize_command_sequence_posix() function

 #-----[ for testing only ]------------------------------------------------
