Terminal utility library
Joe Brendler 15 November 2016

This directory (Terminal) includes the source code for my c++ shared object library libTerminal.so and the parts
that go into making it.

Bottom line: # make clean && make && make install (run as root) will install the shared object library in /usr/lib so you
use it it your own c++ projects.

terminalLibTest is just a demo program to show how you can employ the shared object library in your own programs.

progress.cpp (compiled to the executable "progress") is a another example, and it is a tool you can employ in your
scripts to show progress during the execution of a multi-step process.  The script progress-example.sh demonstrates.

Terminal.h defines the utility functions available in the library

colorHeader.h defines the constant values of the escape sequences that generate color, etc

Makefile provides targets for compiling
  make -> compiles all
  make install -> installs the libTerminal.so shared object library in /usr/lib
  make clean -> removes all .o and .so files from the current directory and removes libTerminal.so from /usr/lib
  make progress -> compiles the stand-alone progress-meter utility
