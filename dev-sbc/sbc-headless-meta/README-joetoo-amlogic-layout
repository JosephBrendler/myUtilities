Note:  joetoo layout for amlogic boards is based on what armbian does
    - generally, this is either just a single partition for the whole system, or
      a second partition for /boot (normally vfat), however - the sweet-potato
      board comes pre-loaded with u-boot on an SPI-NOR, and boots in efi, so --
    - the sweet-potato layout is on a gpt partition table, with the first (vfat)
      partition built (as required by gpt) as an "EFI System" partition
    - the sweet-potato rootfs is on a second (ext4) partition mounted at /, and
      the EFI System partition is mounted at /boot/efi
    - you can manipulate the layout used for your board with dev-sbc/crossbuild-tools
      cb-mkdev (which calls cb-layout-device according to user-maintained config file),
      but this layout is recommended
