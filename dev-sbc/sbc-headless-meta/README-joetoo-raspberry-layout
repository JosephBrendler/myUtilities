Note:  For "Legacy minimal Raspberry Pi" The RaspberryPi Imager (v1.8.5) creates output
  that indicates it now relies on pi-gen (https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen,) to produce
  a layout for /boot including a "firmware" mountpoint for a partition that contains all
  boot code/firmware -- /boot/firmware -- This inclues --
    - bootcode files (.dat, .elf, .bin)
    - config files (cmdline.txt and config.txt)
    - generic kernel images (e.g. kernel.img, kernel7.img, kernel8.img, kernel_2712.img)
    - regular device tree blobs (e.g. bcm2708-rpi-b.dtb ... bcm2712-rpi-5-b)

The actual /boot folder is no longer a mountpoint.  It contains links --
  overlays --> /boot/firmware/overlays
  issue.txt --> /boot/firmware/issue.txt
  as well as "empty" config files whose contents tell the user --
    e.g. "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE... The file you are looking for has moved to /boot/firmware/config.txt"
    and  "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE... The file you are looking for has moved to /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt"
  /boot also contains kernel files evidetnly output by the new pi-gen, e.g. --
    vmlinuz-6.6.20+rpt-rpi-v6 (and counterparts -v7, -v7l, and -v8)
    initrd.img-6.6.20+rpt-rpi-v6
    config-6.6.20+rpt-rpi-v6
    System.map-6.6.20+rpt-rpi-v6

It is not yet clear to me how the pi's bootloader identifies and uses this new structure,
  but it evidently does so, even for my original raspberry pi model b (bcm2708-rpi-b),
  as it produces output clearly coming from the traditional debian initrd that it now uses

However, my joetoo packages install to /boot as it was previously populated.
  This includes --
    - sys-boot/raspi-boot-firmware
    - sys-boot/sbc-boot-config
    - dev-sbc/sbc-headless-meta
    - sys-kernel/linux-bcm27xx-rpi-xxx_kernel_image

Thus, for now, I will keep the rasbian-generated content in a backup folder
  /raspbian_fs -- which will include the original /boot conent, albeit with "firmware"
  directly populated (not a mounted partition).

And, for now, I will populate /boot as it has traditionally been done...
