Note:  joetoo layout for rockchip boards is based on what armbian does
    - generally, this is either just a single partition for the whole system, or
      a second partition for /boot (normally vfat)
    - you can manipulate the layout used for your board with dev-sbc/crossbuild-tools
      cb-mkdev (which calls cb-layout-device according to user-maintained config file)
