# configure gpio lines to be used in sbc headless status monitor
#
# unlike other sbc's the x4 writes status to its internam microcontroller
# over an internal serial port.  joetoo convention is that the
# rp2040 microcontroller will have a green, yellow, and red leds
# in the same physical pin locations as other sbc, but it will use
# a custom firmware developed for the rp2040 to set these LEDs on/off
# and that fimware will read a single status byte from the serial port.
# joetoo convention will be that the x4 uses -
# status bit 0 to set the green led,
# status bit 1 to set the yellow led, and
# status bit 2 to set the red led
