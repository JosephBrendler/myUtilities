#!/bin/bash
#
# draft command to transfer a system image file (presumably created as a sparse file)
# using rsync so that the destination file will also be such a sparse file
# (scp does not do so)
# Notes:
#    -a preserves ownership and permissions
#    -z uses compression for transmission
#    -P combines --partial and --progress options
#        --progress shows real-time transfer progress
#        --partial is "keep partial" so that you can issue the same command again
#            if the transfer was interrupted (i.e. makes it "resumable")
#    --sparse instructs rsync to create a sparse destination file
#    --stats will print statistics after job completion
#
