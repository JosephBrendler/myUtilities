put your custom content in a directory like this one

All files should be named and saved in a structure relative to the
target image root /

e.g. your local wifi configuration could be placed in this folder 
(/etc/crossbuild-tools/custom_content/stuff_for_mkimg_template/)
with  the continued path
etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
