Note:  this directory structure is sourced to /etc/${PN}/mkimg-files/ so that you can

** subsequently populate it with files you want included in the process of populating a
fully configured bootable image **

Do NOT try to put such (sensitive) files in the ebuild which will be posted on the open internet...

The script "finalize-chroot-image" will execute the transfers to populate such files...
