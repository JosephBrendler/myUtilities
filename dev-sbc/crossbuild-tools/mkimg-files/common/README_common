Note:  this directory structure is sourced to /etc/${PN}/mkimg-files/ in order
to provide the basic additional filesystem structure that should be customized
for each individual deployed system.

****** DO NOT ADD or REMOVE content from /etc/${PN}/mkimg-files/ ******

cb-populate-image is designed to allow you to provide additional custom content
*** at /etc/${PN}/custom_content/ *** with the symlink "/etc/${PN}/custom_content/mkimg-files"
pointing your custom content source tree

you can also use the provided cb-populate-image.eselect module to set that symlink
to point to the content you have placed in /etc/${PN}/custom_content/

alternatively, instead of placing custom content in /etc/${PN}/custom_content/, 
you could keep it elsewhere (e.g. your /home/${username} directory) and put a
symlink to your else-where location in /etc/${PN}/custom_content/

such a layout would look like this --

  mkimg-files -> stuff_for_mkimg_edget6401
  stuff_for_mkimg_edget6401 -> /home/joe/stuff_for_mkimg_edget6401

Do NOT try to put such (sensitive) files in the ebuild which will be posted on the open internet...
