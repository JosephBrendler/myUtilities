This package contains files needed to create and populate a
crossbuild target filesystem in order for it to function as
a qemu-chroot crossbuild structure and subsequently as a
binary package host (binhost) server.

Currently, the following TARGET systems are
available, and they must be used as indicated
below --

armv6j-unknown-linux-gnueabihf  --  
  populate with files to function as binhost for
  Raspberry Pi 1 (armv6j, 32 bit)

armv7a-unknown-linux-gnueabihf  --
  populate with files to function as bihnost for
  Raspberry Pi 2B or 3A (armv7a, 32 bit)

aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu -- 
  populate with files to function as bihnost for
  Raspberry Pi 3B+ (armv8a, 64 bit)

NOTES: 

(1) TARGET aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu does not
  yet support Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 (** different
  march for these cpus **)

(2) cross-compiling with rust is not yet working
  (as annotated in steps)

(3) binpkg hosting is not yet working - 
  it seems chroot-built packages are endig up in 
  /usr/${TARGET}/usr/${TARGET}/var/cache/binpkgs
  (instead of /usr/${TARGET}/var/cache/binpkgs
  but there are some packages in the latter, too)
  (still investigating...)
