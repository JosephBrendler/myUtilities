# cloudsync.conf
# Configuration file for  cloudsync, synchronization of a (mesh or hub-spoke
#    topology) set of rudimentary "cloud" participants on your network.
# Author: Joe Brendler 1 June 2014. Packaged with ebuild 2 February 2017.
#         version update 20220117 - reads PKGDIR from make.conf
# This file is sourced in the cloudsync script, so each non-commented
#    line must be a valid script command (variable assignment)
# Default values are commented below. Un-comment and modify the values
#    below according to the layout of your system.

# In the sections below, you may reassign the defaults asociated with the three
#   categories of cloudsync synchronization - content, scripts, and packages.
# Note that the local_[scripts|conttent|packages]_folder is a directory name, whereas the
#   remote_[scripts|conttent|packages]_folder is the name of an area defined by an "[area]"
#   heading in /etc/rsyncd.conf on the remote machine (it is not a directory name)
# Note that in each case, the serverlist variable tells THIS participant to sync
#   with which remote sync-mesh participants.
# --- do not include leading nor trailing "/" in folderlists
# --- do not include trailing "/" in directory names

# PORTDIR, PKGDIR, DISTDIR must be evaluated in this order if e.g. PKGDIR=${PORTDIR}/packages
#eval $( grep ^PORTDIR /etc/portage/make.conf )
#eval $( grep ^PKGDIR /etc/portage/make.conf )
#eval $( grep ^DISTDIR /etc/portage/make.conf )
# source make.conf b/c we can't do it this way for systems that set e.g. PORTDIR="${ROOT}var/db/repos/gentoo"
