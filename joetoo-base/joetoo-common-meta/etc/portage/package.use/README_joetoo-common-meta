README_joetoo-common-meta

joetoo-base/joetoo-common-meta was created 8/18/25 -- first by separation of
binrepos, make.conf, package.use, and package.accept_keywords
from  "joetoo-base/joetoo-meta" as four packages and then by consolidation
of those platform-specific packages into a separate package called
joetoo-base/joetoo-platform-meta

General Idea:
(1) joetoo-base/joetoo-common-meta no longer requires board-specific USE flags

(2) joetoo-base/joetoo-platform-meta does require board-specific USE flags, and
  (a) joetoo-common-meta depends on joetoo-platform-meta
  (b) joetoo-platform-meta should be installed before joetoo-common-meta,
      with code such as --
  # USE="sbc <BOARD> plasma -headless -gnome" emerge -av1 joetoo-base/joetoo-platform-meta
  (which will install make.conf, package.use, package.accept_keywords, etc)
  (c) the user should then edit those config files before running code such as
  # emerge -av dev-sbc/sbc-headless-meta
  (which will pull in joetoo-base/joetoo-common-meta and all of its associated config files)

(3) Note also that the dev-sbc/crossbuild-tools ebuild also depends on
    joetoo-base/joetoo-platform-meta *sources* --
  (a) Whereas the joetoo-base/joetoo-platform-meta ebuild installs *selected*
      board-specific files into a system's operational file system,
  (b) the dev-sbc/crossbuild-tools ebuild installs *ALL* board-specific files into that
      package's resources structure in /etc/crossbuild-tools.
      Then, running --
      # cb-mkenv -b <BOARD>
      selects automatically runs --
      # USE="sbc <BOARD> plasma -headless -gnome" emerge -av1 joetoo-base/joetoo-platform-meta
      to install files selecte for <BOARD>
