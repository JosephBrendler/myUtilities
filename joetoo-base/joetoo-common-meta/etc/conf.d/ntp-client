# however, if you know what you're doing, and you
# want to use ntpd to set the clock, change this to 'ntpd'

# This default setting should work fine but you should
# change the default 'pool.ntp.org' to something closer
# to your machine.  See http://www.pool.ntp.org/ or
# try running `netselect -s 3 pool.ntp.org`.
