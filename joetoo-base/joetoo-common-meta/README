README
joetoo-base/joetoo-common-meta was created 8/18/25 first by separation of 
binrepos, make.conf, package.use, and package.accept_keywords
from  "joetoo-base/joetoo-meta" as four packages and then by consolidation
of those platform-specific packages into a separate package
(joetoo-base/joetoo-platform-meta)

General Idea:
(1) joetoo-base/joetoo-common-meta now no longer requires board-specific USE flags
(2) joetoo-base/joetoo-platform-meta does require board-specific USE flags, and
  (a) joetoo-common-meta depends on it
  (b) it should be installed before joetoo-common-meta, with code such as 
    USE="sbc <BOARD> plasma -headless -gnome" emerge -av1 joetoo-base/joetoo-platform-meta
      (to install make.conf, package.use, package.accept_keywords, etc
       which should then be edited before running code such as
    emerge -av dev-sbc/sbc-headless-meta (which will pull in joetoo-base/joetoo-common-meta)
(3) Note also that the dev-sbc/crossbuild-tools ebuild also depends on 
    joetoo-base/joetoo-platform-meta *sources* --
  (a) Whereas the joetoo-base/joetoo-platform-meta ebuild installs *selected* board-specific files
      into a system's operational file system,
  (b) the dev-sbc/crossbuild-tools ebuild installs *ALL* board-specific files into that
      packages resources structure in /etc/crossbuild-tools
