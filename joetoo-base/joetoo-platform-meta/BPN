# Note: this won't do anything because there is no /etc/joetoo-platform-meta
# where script_header_joetoo_extended will look for cli tool parts like
#    /etc/crossbuild-tools/local.cmdline_arguments
#    /etc/crossbuild-tools/local.cmdline_compound_arguments
#    /etc/crossbuild-tools/local.usage
# joetoo-platform-meta tools don't currently use those features, but if future
# development requires them, we should probably separate the tools from the
# rest of the joetoo-platform-meta package, so we don't have to install
# a developer-oriented toolset and associated dir in /etc/ on every system
